# Contributing

This repository uses GitHub pull requests for code review.

See the [Joyent Engineering
Guidelines](https://github.com/joyent/eng/blob/master/docs/index.md) for general
best practices expected in this repository.

Contributions should be "make prepush" clean. The "prepush" target runs the
"check" target, which will check for linting and style errors.

If you're changing something non-trivial or user-facing, you may want to submit
an issue first.
